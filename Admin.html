                    <h4>
                        <span style="font-size: 26px;">Sport spirit</span><br />One of the main objectives of the CSEO
                        is to teach good sportsmanship. To do this, coaches and parents must set an example for the
                        players. The harassment of coaches or players has no place and is detrimental to the enjoyment
                        of the game. Adults must set an example. <br /> <br />

                        <span style="font-size: 26px;">Participation</span> <br /> The CSEO aims to promote recreation,
                        well-being, health and friendship. The
                        essential thing is to participate; the victory is a bonus. Each player will receive the same
                        amount of time, but it will also depend on the player and his / her commitment to participation,
                        attendance and compliance with the Code of Conduct. <br /> The CSEO demonstrates a marked
                        interest in respecting the concept of SPORTS SPIRIT concept and expects members, players,
                        coaches, volunteers and other participants to understand and apply this concept during the
                        activities and events of the CSEO. <br /> <br />

                        <span style="font-size: 26px;">Our mission is:</span><br />In order to achieve this goal, we
                        need the full commitment of players, coaches, parents and a large number of volunteers, not only
                        in words but also in gestures. Together we can train players, referees and coaches; celebrate
                        soccer in a pleasant and healthy environment while enhancing the quality of life in our
                        community.

                        <span style="font-size: 26px;">Harassment or abuse by a spectator</span><br />In this case, the
                        coach will wait for a stoppage of play. At the stop, if the coach can determine which team the
                        spectator encourages, he will explain that the behavior of the spectator is considered abusive
                        and will ask him to this control. If the coach can not determine which team the viewer
                        encourages, he will approach the coach of the host team. If the harassment or abuse continues,
                        the coach will ask the viewer to leave the field. It will be necessary to explain to the
                        spectator and appropriate that will leave the part if the spectator refuses to leave the ground.
                        <br /> <br />

                        are mandatory for all ages. <br /> <br />

                        <span style="font-size: 26px;">Ground conditions</span><br />Coaches must ensure that the
                        conditions in the field are safe. Large depressions or stagnant water that exceeds about 2 ft x
                        2 ounces in area, and other similar hazards are reasons for canceling a game. The coach (Nabil)
                        has the final power in deciding if a course is safe.
                        <br /> <br />

                            Field</span><br />Parents and supporters must be on the opposite side of the field where the
                        players are located, enabling coaches to better control the team, facilitate changes and ensure
                        player safety. Parents and coaches are not allowed to be behind the goal line.
                        <br /> <br />

                        <span style="font-size: 26px;">Breaks for drinking water</span><br />Very hot temperatures may
                        require a downtime to allow water to be consumed at each half of the game. One of the coaches
                        must apply. This topic will be discussed and an agreement will be made before the game; the
                        coach will be responsible and will allow a break approximately halfway to each half. The coach
                        will add time to the half during which one or more breaks will be taken to drink water.
                        <br /> <br />

                        <span style="font-size: 26px;">Weather conditions</span><br />Teams must practice and play in
                        bad weather. The practices and parts will be canceled if the City of Ottawa bans land use.
                        Players and coaches must report to the parties unless otherwise directed by the CSEO (Nabil).
                        Coach Nabil will determine if the field or weather conditions are appropriate for the game. Only
                        Nabil can decide to cancel a game on the field.

                    <h3>HOW IT WORKS</h3>
                    <h4>
                        Since 2007, the CSEO soccer club has been bringing young boys and girls, ages 4 to 12, from
                        Orleans to the East Ottawa region together to share their passion: Soccer. The club's
                        players are divided into 4 categories based off their age: U4-5, U6-7, U8-9 and U11-12.
                        The goal of the club has always been to focus on youth by inculcating the basics of soccer,
                        promoting the technical, physiological and physical development of its players, at
                        recreational levels and all in a cordial atmosphere.
                        The CSEO organizes two seasons a year, one outside the end of May to the end of August and
                        another one in the end of October at the end of March.
                        Finally, at each end of the season, a tournament in a family atmosphere is organized with the
                        awarding of medals for each player and others, more fortunate, can also receive a prize.
